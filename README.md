## MYtinerary Travel App

This is an app I built while training to become a fullstack developer in a coding bootcamp.

It is a travel app built with the MERN stack along with Redux for state management.

## Getting Started

Include a `.env` file in the `server` directory with the following environment variables.

db_url = 'mongodb://localhost/<DATABASE_NAME>'

```# Install dependencies for server
npm install

# Install dependencies for client
npm run client-install

# Run the client & server with concurrently
npm run dev

# Run the Express server only
npm run server

# Run the React client only
npm run client

# Server runs on http://localhost:5000 and client on http://localhost:3000
```
